# GASQL
I did a 9 week data analytics immersive with General Assembly early 2021. The first two weeks were a deep dive into SQL queries, mostly 
using a postgreSQL server database, although there are some files using DB Broswer.
I note some SQL queries presented throughout the course. Some are complete, some are interesting queries with comments and explanations.
Some code is incomplete, but take that as part of the fun.
