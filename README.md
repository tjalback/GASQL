# GASQL
I did a 9 week data analytics immersive with General Assembly early 2021. The first two weeks were a deep dive into SQL queries, mostly 
using a postgreSQL server database and a small amount using DB Broswer.
I note some SQL queries presented throughout the course mostly for my own record. 
Some are complete, some are interesting queries with comments and explanations, some code is incomplete.
