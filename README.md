# GASQL
some learnings from GA course with SQL
I did a 9 week data analytics immersive with General Assembly early 2021. The first two weeks were a deep dive into SQL queires, mostly 
using a provided with postgreSQL server database, although there are some queries using DB Broswer.
In this GASQL share, I note some SQL queries presented throughout the course. Some are complete, some are interesting queries with comments.
Some code is incomplete, but take that as part of the fun.
