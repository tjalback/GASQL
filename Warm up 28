-- FOR CITIBIKE bike share data, answer a few questions accross a few years worth of data

WITH all_citi as (SELECT user_type, gender, start_station_id, birth_year

UNION ALL
SELECT user_type, gender, start_station_id, birth_year
FROM citibike_2017
UNION ALL

UNION ALL
SELECT user_type, gender, start_station_id, birth_year
FROM citibike_2019)

-- SELECT COUNT(user_type)
-- FROM all_citi
-- WHERE user_type ILIKE 'Subscriber'

-- SELECT avg(birth_year)
-- FROM all_citi
-- WHERE gender = 2

-- SELECT count(start_station_id) as count_station, start_station_id
-- FROM all_citi
-- GROUP BY start_station_id
-- ORDER BY count_station DESC
-- -- 3186

-- probably need a join here, but searching directly for the station_id we can get the station name

SELECT * 
FROM citibike_stations
WHERE id = 3186
